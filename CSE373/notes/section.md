# Section Notes

## Section 1 (28 Mar)

- Passing by Value: When we pass a variable into a function it creates a copy, so any changes that are made dissappear after the function is finished.
- Passing by Reference: When we pass an object (e.g. an array) as a parameter we pass a reference, so any changes that are made stay.
- Briefly analyzed queues, stacks, and implementations using arrays and linked lists.
