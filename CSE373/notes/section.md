# Section Notes

## Section 1 (28 Mar)

- Passing by Value: When we pass a variable into a function it creates a copy, so any changes that are made dissappear after the function is finished.
- Passing by Reference: When we pass an object (e.g. an array) as a parameter we pass a reference, so any changes that are made stay.
- Briefly analyzed queues, stacks, and implementations using arrays and linked lists.

## Section 2 (4 Apr)

- Asymptotic notation describes an algorithms runtime as a function of its input as its input goes to infinity.
- $O(N)$ describes the runtime, while the asymptotic variable $N$ represents the algorithms input as it goes to infinity.
- An abstract data type (ADT) is an interface which describes what methods a data type should have.
- A data structure is the specific implementation of the ADT.
