# Creative Project 0: Connect Four

## Basic Requirements

- The game board is a 7-wide by 6-tall grid.
- Players' tokens are placed in the bottom-most available space in the column selected for a move.
- Four of the same player’s tokens in a row either horizontally or vertically triggers the end condition.
- Your program file should be named ConnectFour.java, and therefore your class should be named ConnectFour

## Extended Requirements

- At the start of each turn, the active player may choose to either remove one of their tokens from the board or place a token (but not both). The player is able to remove one of their own tokens from the bottom row of any column, shifting all other tokens in that column (if any) down by one row.
- Four of the same player’s tokens in a row diagonally triggers the end condition (in addition to the horizontal and vertical end conditions).
