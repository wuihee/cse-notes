# Programming Assigmnent 1: Mini Git

## Goal

Implement a "mini Git" by implementing a Repository class that can perform different operatiosn related to "commits".

## Structure

- We can use a Linked List to chain together commits. Therefore, each `Repository` is a Linked List, and each `Commit` is a List Node.
